to recap perhaps

for better knowledge retention you should be doing the recap, but let me help you this time.

There are two industries that call their customers 'Users': tech and the shady guys close to the entrance of a rave party.

If you feel that your gadets are controlling you, instead of the other way around then know that it's not your fault, it is by design!

Tech at it's best
productivity
creativity
connection

Tech at it's worst

distraction
pure consumption
loneliness

I've experienced the highest peaks and the lowerst black holes. Hence I'm a Technophile and a Tehnocritic (Technosceptic)

ABOUT ME
All of the above is true - I'm a techie who has been abused by tech. Tech has been my passion, my hobbie, my career and my unhealthy coping mechanism and cause for distress.

I think I have been ahead of the curve with the struggles as well as the solutions.
