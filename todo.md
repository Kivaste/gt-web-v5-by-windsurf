to recap perhaps

for better knowledge retention you should be doing the recap, but let me help you this time.

There are two industries that call their customers 'Users': tech and the shady guys close to the entrance of a rave party.

If you feel that your gadets are controlling you, instead of the other way around then know that it's not your fault, it is by design!

----------


Tech at it's best
productivity
creativity
connection

Tech at it's worst

distraction
pure consumption
loneliness

I've experienced the highest peaks and the lowerst black holes. Hence I'm a Technophile and a Tehnocritic (Technosceptic)

ABOUT ME
All of the above is true - I'm a techie who has been abused by tech. Tech has been my passion, my hobbie, my career and my unhealthy coping mechanism and cause for distress. 

My dad was a programmer so I've had a computer at home since I can remember. My youth was spent gaming all night and then skipping school. 


I think I have been ahead of the curve with the struggles as well as the solutions.
