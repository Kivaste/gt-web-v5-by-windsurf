Cookies - sweet or clingy?

Your barista remembers your latte and your name. Sweet!
First‑party cookies do that - login, preferences, that shopping cart you abandoned.

Guy in a van? Different vibe.
Third‑party cookies follow you everywhere, log everything, report to advertisers. That abandoned cart haunting every page? That's them.

to recap perhaps

for better knowledge retention you should be doing the recap, but let me help you this time.

There are two industries that call their customers 'Users': tech and the shady guys close to the entrance of a rave party.

If you feel that your gadets are controlling you, instead of the other way around then know that it's not your fault, it is by design!



Survival of the fittest

Select which of these two do you like better?

That's your opinion, everybody has one. But if we randomly split that 50% of site users see A and the other 50% B. If we then let thousands or even millions of users see each we can clearly see which brought in more money.  

This is called A/B testing.

Survival of the Fittest

Which do you like: A or B? 

Cute. Split traffic randomly 50/50, let thousands vote with their wallets, and keep whichever makes more money. That’s A/B testing.


Pick your favorite (click):

A  B

Cool. Opinions are vibes, revenue decides.  
Cute. Hunches are cheap, data is truth.

Split 100,000 visitors - half see A, half see B. Let the wallets vote. 

That's called A/B testing. Like Darwin for profits. 




Tech at it's best

productivity
creativity
connection

Tech at it's worst

distraction
pure consumption
loneliness

I've experienced the highest peaks and the lowerst black holes. Hence I'm a Technophile and a Tehnocritic (Technosceptic)
