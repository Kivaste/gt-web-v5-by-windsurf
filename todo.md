Cookies - sweet or clingy?

Your barista remembers your latte and your name. Sweet!
First‑party cookies do that - login, preferences, that shopping cart you abandoned.

Guy in a van? Different vibe.
Third‑party cookies follow you everywhere, log everything, report to advertisers. That abandoned cart haunting every page? That's them.

to recap perhaps

for better knowledge retention you should be doing the recap, but let me help you this time.

There are two industries that call their customers 'Users': tech and the shady guys close to the entrance of a rave party.

If you feel that your gadets are controlling you, instead of the other way around then know that it's not your fault, it is by design!



Survival of the fittest

Select which of these two do you like better?

That's your opinion, everybody has one. But if we randomly split that 50% of site users see A and the other 50% B. If we then let thousands or even millions of users see each we can clearly see which brought in more money.  

This is called A/B testing.
---
Survival of the Fittest

Which do you like: A or B? 

Cute. Split traffic randomly 50/50, let thousands vote with their wallets, and keep whichever makes more money. That’s A/B testing.


Pick your favorite (click):

A  B

Cool. Opinions are vibes, revenue decides.  
Cute. Hunches are cheap, data is truth.

Split 100,000 visitors - half see A, half see B. Let the wallets vote. 

That's called A/B testing. Like Darwin for profits. 




Tech at it's best
n
productivity
creativity
connection

Tech at it's worst

distraction
pure consumption
loneliness

I've experienced the highest peaks and the lowerst black holes. Hence I'm a Technophile and a Tehnocritic (Technosceptic)

Why do websites look like clones?
=> 
Most websites look the same

Websites aren't brochures. They're fine-tuned decision engines nudging you to one outcome: your credit card.

HOOKED

no, seriously, the book is called literally 'Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products'



-----



My gf is a marketer. She says I'm doing everything wrong here. I think she'd be right 99.99% of the time. But I hope I'm special. One in a million. 

Because, this is who I am. I love technology, yet it's been like an abusive partner sending me through the lowest dark holes - gaming, social media, porn, gambling, news. My sleep, my physical and mental health, my relationships - all have suffered. So I'm critical how it's designed to take advantage of us. First, I want you to know that it's not your fault! You've been Hooked. Secondly, it's reversable and I want to help you to become a gadgetTamer.

So you can take control and tame the phone/computer/attention/social media/news/emails/ads


CTA - should be one action, I'm even screwing that up!


but if the wish really comes from you, it'd be happy if you sign up.

Option 1:
My gf's a marketer. Says I'm doing this all wrong. She's probably right.

But I can't sell you what hurt me. Tech put me through hell—gaming, socials, porn, gambling, doomscrolling. Wrecked my sleep, health, relationships.

So yeah, I'm critical of how it's designed to hook you. It's not your fault. And it's reversible.

Option 2:
My gf (a marketer) says I'm breaking every rule here. Fair.

But tech's been an abusive relationship for me—gaming, scrolling, porn, gambling, news. It destroyed my sleep, health, sanity.

That's why I see the manipulation clearly. You're not weak—you've been hooked. And I can help you unhook.

Option 3:
Marketer gf says I'm doing this wrong. Probably.

But I won't use tactics that destroyed me. Gaming, socials, porn, gambling, news—tech nearly broke me. Sleep, health, relationships, gone.

Now I see the hooks everywhere. It's not you—it's the design. Let's reverse it.

Option 4 (minimal):



My gf's a marketer. Says this breaks all the rules.

Good! Those rules hooked me for years - games, social feeds, porn, gambling, doomscrolling news. Ruined my sleep, physical and mental health, relationships.

I'm not anti-tech. Quite the opposite, I love tech. I'm just anti-manipulative-design.

You're not broken. Your brain's been hacked. Let's tame your 









    My girlfriend’s a marketer; she says I’m doing this wrong. She’s right 99.99% of the time—I’m betting on the 0.01%. I love tech, but it hijacked me—games, feeds, porn, gambling, news—wrecking sleep, health, relationships. It’s not your fault; you were hooked. It’s fixable. I can help you tame your tech.

    I love tech. It hijacked me—games, feeds, porn, gambling, news—and trashed my sleep, health, relationships. If you’re hooked, it’s not your fault. It’s fixable. I’ll help you take back control.

    Tech played me: games, feeds, porn, slots, news—on loop. If it can hack your brain, we can hack it back. I’ll show you.

    Hooked by tech? Not your fault. Fixable. I’ll help you tame your tech.

    She’s right 999,999 times out of a million. I’m aiming to be the one. Tech hooked me; I learned to unhook it. I can help you do the same.


 I'm just anti-ad-driven-manipulative-design. I'm against our attention being sold for fractions of a cent. 



ABOUT ME
All of the above is true - I'm a techie who has been abused by tech. Tech has been my passion, my hobbie, my career and my unhealthy coping mechanism and cause for distress. 

My dad was a programmer so I've had a computer at home since I can remember. My youth was spent gaming all night and then skipping school. 


I think I have been ahead of the curve with the struggles as well as the solutions. .
