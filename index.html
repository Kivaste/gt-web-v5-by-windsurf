      <h2>Why Do All Websites Look the Same?</h2>
      <p>Homepages, landing pages, sales pages‚Äîoften impersonal, copy-paste templates. But there's a reason: proven patterns that work. Feeling the "rush" and urgency is part of the formula.</p>
      <p><em>every website is designed to grab your attention and guide you toward a decision - to enter your credit card details. Let's break the illusion wide open!</em></p>

    <!-- Cookies -->
    <section id="cookiesSection" class="slide" data-slide-title="Cookies">
      <h2>Everybody loves cookies! (until they follow you) üç™</h2>
      <p>Not the chocolate‚Äëchip kind. Cookies are tiny text crumbs your browser saves so sites can remember things about you. Handy‚Ä¶ and also a little clingy.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>First‚Äëparty cookies:</strong> set by the site you're on ‚Äî logins, carts, "remember me," that sort of useful stuff.</li>
        <li><strong>Third‚Äëparty cookies:</strong> set by outsiders embedded on the page (ad networks, social widgets, analytics). That's how the same folks can spot you across many sites.</li>
        <li><strong>Session vs. persistent:</strong> session cookies vanish when you close the tab; persistent cookies stick around for days or months, like glitter after a craft accident.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Retargeting in 4 steps (aka "why am I seeing those exact shoes?")</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>You check out Product X on Site A. A tiny "ad pixel" from AdCo loads.</li>
        <li>AdCo drops a <em>third‚Äëparty</em> cookie: "User looked at Product X."</li>
        <li>Later on Site B (also running AdCo), your browser presents that cookie to AdCo.</li>
        <li>AdCo recognizes you and serves an ad for Product X everywhere, forever. Or at least until the cookie expires.</li>
      </ol>

      <div class="cookie-tools">
        <div class="tool-row">
          <span class="k">Third‚Äëparty cookies</span>
          <span class="v">
            <span id="thirdPartyCookiesStatus" class="status-badge status-unknown">Checking‚Ä¶</span>

          <span id="siteDataStatus" aria-live="polite"></span>
        </div>
      </div>

      <small>Note: Many browsers now block third‚Äëparty cookies by default. Retargeting still happens via newer tricks (first‚Äëparty tracking, server‚Äëside stitching, hashed emails). The game evolves.</small>

    <!-- A/B Testing -->
    <section id="abTestingSection" class="slide" data-slide-title="A/B Testing">
      <h2>A/B Testing: stop guessing, start splitting</h2>
      <p>Marketing opinions are free. Evidence is expensive. Here's the cheap version:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Pick one thing to mess with: headline, button text, price anchoring, whatever.</li>
        <li>Randomly show A or B to visitors. No peeking at the results "just to check."</li>
        <li>Measure one clear metric (clicks, signups, buys). Not "feelings."</li>
        <li>Let it run long enough to matter. "We got 12 clicks" is not a conclusion.</li>
        <li>Winner goes live. Loser goes to the big archive in the sky.</li>
      </ul>
      <small>Serious A/B requires tooling or backend logic. This is your heads‚Äëup that "best practices" are just hypotheses with a good PR team.</small>

      <h2>Free Materials</h2>
      <p>Are they really free though? The price is your email and attention.

      <h2>Why a Pop-Up?</h2>

      <h2>FAQ</h2>
      <dl>
        <dt>Is this really different from any other landing page?</dt>
        <dd>Yes‚Äîbecause you now understand the persuasion levers being pulled on every other site you visit.</dd>
        <dt>Do I have to buy something right away?</dt>
        <dd>Nope. Absorb the lessons, sleep on it, and come back when you're ready to tame your gadgets.</dd>
        <dt>Will you spam me?</dt>
        <dd>Only with useful, human-written insights. No bots, no blanket blasts.</dd>

      <h2>Pricing & Guarantees</h2>

    <section class="slide" data-slide-title="Personal Note">
      <h2>Personal Note</h2>
      <p>My marketing partner says I'm doing everything wrong‚Äîand she's almost always right. The tested way usually works, but I'd rather trust honesty over polish. Sure, that loses some sales, but at least I sleep better at night (well‚Ä¶ when I'm not writing web pages at 4:30 AM).</p>
