Let's improve the personal note slide:

1. The comment box should have a title: You must be furious - I got the math wrong!
2. The default/placeholder text should be: so here's a comment box for you to leave your corrections ... angrily
3. email field between the text box and button with the title: if you wish to get a reply then leave your email. It should also check for email having a valid email structure
4. The button should be inactive (gray) unless something is written to the text box





Next steps
0. fix the comment form
    - make the comment box default size three rows (without showing the scrollbar, i think currently it's 4 rows)
    - leave less space between the comment box and the main copy
    - how to save this input - airtable maybe?
1. work on copy
2. fix popups 
    - why a popup text to the first popup that appears
    - leaving and scrolling to the top as the default text unless the popup section hasn't happened then why a popup
    - 
3. add email collection via Kit
4. add hooked model exercise
5. webinar CTA
