Current order
1. Welcome (hero)
2. Why Similar (pattern reveal)
3. Special Offer (yellow banner)
4. Why Trust Us
5. Free Materials
6. Data Trail

Observations
- Strong hook, but persuasion banner precedes trust building.
- Data Trail is powerful proof but arrives late.
- "Free Materials" feels softer than the banner CTA.

Proposed order
1. Welcome (hook)
2. Why Similar (context/problem)
3. Data Trail (reveal how youâ€™re already tracked)
4. Why Trust Us (authority/credibility)
5. Special Offer (high-urgency CTA)
6. Free Materials (lower-friction fallback)

Rationale
- Establish problem, then show evidence to raise stakes before asking for trust.
- Place credibility before any hard sell to avoid resistance.
- Finish with a softer offer so readers who skip the urgent CTA still convert.
